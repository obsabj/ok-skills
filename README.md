# OK Skills: AI Coding Agent Skills for Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, and More

English | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

Curated AI coding agent skills and AGENTS.md playbooks for Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, Trae, and other SKILL.md-compatible tools.

This repo currently bundles **40 reusable skills**: **22 top-level skills** maintained directly in this repo, plus **18 vendored design skills** under [`impeccable/`](impeccable/README.md). The repository layout already matches the skills convention, so you can clone it directly into `~/.agents/skills` and trigger skills from `AGENTS.md`.

## Who This Repo Is For

- You use Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, Trae, or another AI coding agent and want reusable skills instead of ad-hoc prompts.
- You maintain `AGENTS.md` / `SKILL.md` workflows and want portable instructions that work across projects.
- You need battle-tested skills for docs lookup, browser automation, GitHub workflow, planning, prompt engineering, frontend design, PDF, and spreadsheets.

## Start Here

If you only install a few skills first, start with these:

- [planning-with-files](planning-with-files/SKILL.md): file-based planning for complex tasks, research, and long-running work.
- [ctx7-cli](ctx7-cli/SKILL.md): fetch current library docs and Context7-backed references.
- [agent-browser](agent-browser/SKILL.md): browser automation for screenshots, forms, scraping, and web QA.
- [gh-fix-ci](gh-fix-ci/SKILL.md): inspect failing GitHub Actions checks and turn logs into a fix plan.
- [prompt-engineering-patterns](prompt-engineering-patterns/SKILL.md): production-oriented prompt patterns for more reliable LLM workflows.
- [impeccable/frontend-design](impeccable/frontend-design/SKILL.md): high-quality frontend design skill plus a full bundle of companion design commands.

## 1-Minute Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mxyhi/ok-skills.git ~/.agents/skills
```

This works because the repo root already follows the expected layout:

```text
~/.agents/skills/
  planning-with-files/
    SKILL.md
  ctx7-cli/
    SKILL.md
  agent-browser/
    SKILL.md
  ...
```

Add simple trigger rules to your `AGENTS.md`:

```md
## Skills
- planning-with-files: Use for complex tasks, research, or anything that will take 5+ tool calls.
- ctx7-cli: Use when you need current library docs, API references, or Context7-backed examples.
- agent-browser: Use for browser automation, screenshots, scraping, web testing, or form filling.
```

Then ask naturally:

- `Use planning-with-files before refactoring this module.`
- `Use ctx7-cli to fetch the latest docs for this SDK.`
- `Use agent-browser to reproduce this UI bug.`
