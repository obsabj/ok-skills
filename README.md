[![Mentioned in Awesome Codex CLI](https://awesome.re/mentioned-badge.svg)](https://github.com/RoggeOhta/awesome-codex-cli)

Curated AI coding agent skills and AGENTS.md playbooks for Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, OpenClaw, Trae, and other SKILL.md-compatible tools.

This repo currently bundles **57 reusable skills**: **31 top-level skills** maintained directly in this repo, plus **18 vendored design skills** under [`impeccable/`](impeccable/README.md), plus **8 vendored GSAP animation skills** under [`gsap-skills/`](gsap-skills/). Clone it into `~/.agents/skills/ok-skills`; the directories inside already match the layout expected by `AGENTS.md`-driven workflows.

If you are looking for **Codex skills**, **Claude Code skills**, **Cursor skills**, **OpenClaw skills**, reusable **AGENTS.md** playbooks, or practical **SKILL.md** examples, this repository is designed to be both searchable and immediately usable.

**Popular use cases:** docs lookup, browser automation, GitHub Actions debugging, prompt engineering, planning workflows, frontend design, PDF/Word/PPTX/XLSX authoring.

## Who This Repo Is For

- You use Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, OpenClaw, Trae, or another AI coding agent and want reusable skills instead of ad-hoc prompts.
- You maintain `AGENTS.md` / `SKILL.md` workflows and want portable instructions that work across projects.
- You need battle-tested skills for docs lookup, browser automation, GitHub workflow, planning, prompt engineering, frontend design, PDFs, Office documents, slide decks, and spreadsheets.

## Start Here

If you only install a few skills first, start with these:

- [planning-with-files](planning-with-files/SKILL.md): file-based planning for complex tasks, research, and long-running work.
- [context7-cli](context7-cli/SKILL.md): fetch current library docs and Context7-backed references.
- [agent-browser](agent-browser/SKILL.md): browser automation for screenshots, forms, scraping, and web QA.
- [gh-fix-ci](gh-fix-ci/SKILL.md): inspect failing GitHub Actions checks and turn logs into a fix plan.
- [prompt-engineering-patterns](prompt-engineering-patterns/SKILL.md): production-oriented prompt patterns for more reliable LLM workflows.
- [impeccable/frontend-design](impeccable/frontend-design/SKILL.md): high-quality frontend design skill plus a full bundle of companion design commands.

## 1-Minute Quick Start

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.agents/skills
cd ~/.agents/skills
git clone https://github.com/mxyhi/ok-skills.git ok-skills
```

After cloning, the repo lives at `~/.agents/skills/ok-skills`, and the directories inside already follow the expected layout:

```text
~/.agents/skills/ok-skills/
  planning-with-files/
    SKILL.md
  context7-cli/
    SKILL.md
  agent-browser/
    SKILL.md
  ...
```

Add simple trigger rules to your `AGENTS.md`:

```md
## Skills

- planning-with-files: Use for complex tasks, research, or anything that will take 5+ tool calls.
- context7-cli: Use when you need current library docs, API references, or Context7-backed examples.
- agent-browser: Use for browser automation, screenshots, scraping, web testing, or form filling.
```

Then ask naturally:

- `Use planning-with-files before refactoring this module.`
- `Use context7-cli to fetch the latest docs for this SDK.`
- `Use agent-browser to reproduce this UI bug.`
