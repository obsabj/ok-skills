# OK Skills

English | [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

A curated collection of skills for the pi coding agent / Codex / Claude Code and other agents.

## What This Repo Includes

- Ready-to-use skills under separate folders (`<skill-name>/SKILL.md`).
- Optional references/scripts/licenses bundled with individual skills when needed.
- A bilingual overview (`README.md` + `README.zh-CN.md`).

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository.
2. Copy the skill folders you need into your local skill directory (for example: `~/.codex/skills` or `~/.agents/skills`).
3. In your project instructions (such as `AGENTS.md`), define when each skill should be triggered.
4. Invoke by name or ask naturally; the agent can pick matching skills based on intent.

No build step is required.
